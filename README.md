## Introduction

This package provides a collection of Python tools for the common vBase platform tasks.

The vBase platform enables distributed computing using untrusted 3rd party data.
Consumers of data and models can perform calculations on externally-managed data
with the same confidence and assurances as with internal enterprise data.
Below are some applications:
- A stock picker can maintain an index of stock picks to prove live track record.
- A credit analyst can maintain a model of default risk to prove its out-of-sample performance accuracy.
- A weather data service can prove that data and models it has published in the past 
were more accurate at forecasting than a given benchmark. 

Verifiable calculations need not reveal the underlying models and data.
